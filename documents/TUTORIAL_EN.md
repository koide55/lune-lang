# Lune v0.1 Tutorial

Let's play with a small lazy-evaluation language.

Lune is still an experimental language in its early stages. Even so, it already has some fun features.

- Python-style indentation syntax.
- ML-style `fn`, `type`, and `match`.
- Lazy evaluation by default.
- Closures created naturally via partial application.
- `Option` / `Result` / `List` available out of the box.
- Lightweight `record` with field access.
- Small imperative loops with `while`.
- Natural list traversal with `for`.
- A small type checker included.
- `T?` (nullable) for safely handling "maybe-missing" values.
- `|>` to chain steps left to right.
- Tools that teach: `lune explain` / `lune fmt` / `lune fix`.

This tutorial walks through the "fun parts of writing Lune" with actual working code.

## 1. First Steps

Working directory:

```sh
cd lune_v0_1
```

For trying expressions and declarations, the REPL is handy.

```sh
./bin/lune
```

Running `./bin/lune` with no arguments starts the REPL. To evaluate a file, pass CLI arguments to the same script.

The REPL started in a terminal supports line editing similar to a Bash command line.

- Arrow keys to move the cursor left and right.
- Up/down arrow keys to navigate history.
- Backspace / Delete to edit.
- `Ctrl-A` to jump to the beginning of the line, `Ctrl-E` to the end.

History is saved to `~/.lune_history` when possible. Being able to recall a recently tried expression with the up key makes experimentation much easier.

To evaluate a file:

```sh
./bin/lune --eval answer samples/records.lune
```

To only type-check:

```sh
./bin/lune --check samples/records.lune
```

## 2. `let` Is Lazy

Lune's `let` does not compute a value immediately — it waits until the value is needed.

```lune
let x = 1 + 2
let answer = x * 10
```

This looks ordinary. But you can see lazy evaluation at work by placing a failing expression:

```lune
let danger = crash()
let answer = 42
```

Evaluating `answer` never uses `danger`, so `crash()` is never evaluated.

```sh
./bin/lune --eval answer your_file.lune
```

Result:

```text
42
```

The intuition for lazy evaluation is less "place a value here" and more "place a promise to compute when needed."

## 3. Function Arguments Are Also Lazy

Function arguments are also lazy by default.

```lune
def first(a: Int, b: Int): Int =
    a

let answer = first(10, crash())
```

[▶ Open in the Playground](https://koide55.github.io/lune-lang/playground/#s=eyJjIjoiZGVmIGZpcnN0KGE6IEludCwgYjogSW50KTogSW50ID1cbiAgICBhXG5cbmxldCBhbnN3ZXIgPSBmaXJzdCgxMCwgY3Jhc2goKSlcbiIsImIiOiIiLCJ0IjpmYWxzZSwibCI6ImVuIn0)

Since `first` never uses `b`, `crash()` is never evaluated.

```text
answer == 10
```

This is powerful when dealing with conditional computation or infinite data structures — you don't have to build things you won't use.

## 4. `strict` for "Evaluate Now"

Sometimes laziness is welcome; other times you want immediate evaluation. For those cases, use `strict` or `!`.

```lune
def ignore(a: Int, !b: Int): Int =
    a

let answer = ignore(10, crash())
```

[▶ Open in the Playground](https://koide55.github.io/lune-lang/playground/#s=eyJjIjoiZGVmIGlnbm9yZShhOiBJbnQsICFiOiBJbnQpOiBJbnQgPVxuICAgIGFcblxubGV0IGFuc3dlciA9IGlnbm9yZSgxMCwgY3Jhc2goKSlcbiIsImIiOiIiLCJ0IjpmYWxzZSwibCI6ImVuIn0)

Here, `b` is a strict argument, so `crash()` is evaluated at the call site.

You can also use it on bindings:

```lune
strict let x = 1 + 2
```

In Lune, the pattern is "lazy by default, strict only where needed."

## 5. `lazy` and `force`

When you want to create a lazy value explicitly, use `lazy`.

```lune
let delayed = lazy (1 + 2)
let answer = force delayed
```

The type of `delayed` is `Lazy[Int]`, and `answer` is `Int`.

Multi-line form also works:

```lune
let delayed = lazy:
    let x = 40
    x + 2

let answer = force delayed
```

Think of `lazy` as a box you open later. `force` computes the contents.

## 6. Memoized Thunks

A lazy value remembers its result once evaluated.

This chapter uses `tick()` and `tickCount()` as observation tools.

- `tick()` increments an internal counter each time it's called and returns the new value.
- `tickCount()` returns the current counter value.

Both are helper functions for observing lazy evaluation behavior. They are not meant for regular application logic.

```lune
let x = tick()
let answer = x + x
let count = tickCount()
```

[▶ Open in the Playground](https://koide55.github.io/lune-lang/playground/#s=eyJjIjoibGV0IHggPSB0aWNrKClcbmxldCBhbnN3ZXIgPSB4ICsgeFxubGV0IGNvdW50ID0gdGlja0NvdW50KClcbiIsImIiOiIiLCJ0IjpmYWxzZSwibCI6ImVuIn0)

> In the Playground, **set the binding to evaluate to `answer` first**. Evaluating `count` first shows `0`: `tick()` does not run until `answer` is forced — which is the lazy evaluation this section is about.

Although `x` is used twice, `tick()` executes only once.

```text
answer == 2
count == 1
```

If `tick()` had run twice, `answer` would be `1 + 2 = 3` and `count` would be `2`. In reality, the thunk for `x` runs `tick()` once when first needed, saves the result `1`, and subsequent uses of `x` just read the saved value.

You can try this in the REPL:

```text
lune> let x = tick()
ok
lune> x + x
2 : Int
lune> tickCount()
1 : Int
```

`tickCount()` itself does not increment the counter — it's a window to see how many times `tick()` actually ran.

This combination of "wait until needed" and "remember once computed" is the core of Lune's lazy evaluation.

### Watching Evaluation Happen — `:thunks` and `:trace`

Everything in the chapters above can be **observed directly** with two REPL commands.

`:thunks` shows the current state of each lazy binding. Displaying it never triggers evaluation.

```text
lune> let x = 1 + 1
ok
lune> :thunks
x : unevaluated          # not computed yet
lune> x
2 : Int
lune> :thunks
x : evaluated = 2        # used once, so the result is now remembered
```

Turn on `:trace on` and every evaluation shows *when and what* was forced, with nesting.

```text
lune> :trace on
trace on
lune> let y = x + 1
ok                       # declarations evaluate nothing
lune> y * 10
force y * 10
  force x + 1            # y is evaluated only now that it is needed
    memo 1 + 1 => 2      # x was memoized; it is not recomputed
  => 3
=> 30
30 : Int
```

Combined with infinite lists (chapter 12), you can see "only as much as needed" in the structure itself. Unevaluated parts print as `<thunk>`.

```text
lune> let nat = naturalsFrom(1)
ok
lune> head(nat)
Some(1) : Option[Int]
lune> :thunks nat
nat : evaluated = Cons(1, <thunk>)   # only the head is computed; the rest is untouched
```

For files, `./bin/lune --eval NAME --trace file.lune` prints the same trace. The browser playground (`playground/`) has a "trace" checkbox too, so you can try all of this without installing anything.

## 7. `fn` and Partial Application

Lambdas are written with `fn`.

```lune
let add = fn x y -> x + y
let answer = add(20, 22)
```

Partial application is also supported:

```lune
let add = fn x y -> x + y
let inc = add(1)
let answer = inc(41)
```

`add` normally takes two arguments, but `add(1)` — passing only one — returns "a function that takes one more argument and then adds." This makes it easy to build small utility functions:

```lune
let double = fn x -> x * 2
let add10 = fn x -> x + 10

let answer = add10(double(16))
```

Small functions like these can be chained with `|>` (the pipeline operator). `x |> f` is the same as `f(x)`, so you can read a computation left to right.

```lune
def inc(n: Int): Int =
    n + 1

def double(n: Int): Int =
    n * 2

let result = 5 |> inc |> double
```

`5 |> inc |> double` is the same as `double(inc(5))`, which is `12`. You can also pipe into a multi-argument function as a partial application (`5 |> add` is `add(5)`).

## 8. Algebraic Data Types for Modeling Shapes

Lune supports algebraic data types (ADTs). The name sounds intimidating, but at first you can think of them simply as "a way to list out the possible shapes a value can take."

```lune
type Option[T] =
    | Some(value: T)
    | None
```

`Option[T]` is a type with two possible shapes:

- `Some(value)` — "there is a value."
- `None` — "there is no value."

This lets you represent "might have a value, might not" with a type instead of `null`.

```lune
let good = Some(42)
let empty = None
```

Use `match` to extract values:

```lune
def getOrElse[T](option: Option[T], defaultValue: T): T =
    match option:
        | Some(value) -> value
        | None -> defaultValue

let answer = getOrElse(Some(42), 0)
```

`match` is the syntax for branching based on the shape of a value.

## 9. Pattern Matching Is Readable

Let's look at a few more examples.

```lune
type Shape =
    | Circle(radius: Int)
    | Rect(width: Int, height: Int)

def area(shape: Shape): Int =
    match shape:
        | Circle(radius) -> radius * radius * 3
        | Rect(width, height) -> width * height

let answer = area(Rect(6, 7))
```

Instead of using `if` to check the kind, you write directly "if this shape, then this." Algebraic data types and `match` are where Lune's functional nature shines.

`match` also checks exhaustiveness. If you forget a shape, the type checker tells you which one is missing, with an example.

```lune
def area(shape: Shape): Int =
    match shape:
        | Circle(radius) -> radius * radius * 3
```

This is a `TYP0007` error because `Rect` is not covered. Write every shape, or add a wildcard `| _ -> ...`. Conversely, a case that is fully covered by earlier cases and can never be reached is reported as a warning (`TYP0009`).

## 10. Records for Named Data

When you just want to group multiple values together, `record` is handy.

```lune
record User:
    name: String
    age: Int

let ada = User(name = "Ada", age = 36)
let answer = ada.age + 6
```

Access fields with `.`:

```lune
let name = ada.name
let age = ada.age
```

Generic records work too:

```lune
record Box[T]:
    value: T

let boxed = Box(value = 42)
let answer = boxed.value
```

In the REPL, record values display in a field-centric format:

```text
lune> ada
{ name = "Ada", age = 36 } : User
```

Regular record fields are also lazy — unused fields are never evaluated.

```lune
record User:
    name: String
    age: Int

let ada = User(name = crash(), age = 36)
let answer = ada.age
```

Since `name` is never accessed, `crash()` is never evaluated.

### `field = value` Is for Records Only

Named arguments like `User(name = "Ada", age = 36)` are **only** for building records. Functions and ADT constructors take positional arguments.

This is an easy one to get wrong, because an ADT constructor does carry field names in its declaration (`Some(value: T)`), which makes it look as though you could pass them by name too.

```lune
type Option[T] =
    | Some(value: T)
    | None

let x = Some(value = 1)
```

```text
error[TYP0012]: named arguments are not supported here: value
  --> opt.lune:5:14
  |
5 | let x = Some(value = 1)
  |              ^^^^^ pass this argument positionally
   = hint: functions and ADT constructors take positional arguments; only records are built with `field = value`
   = help: run `lune explain TYP0012` for a detailed explanation
```

`Some(1)` works. Think of the field names in the declaration as being there to make `match` readable when you destructure the value.

## 11. Living Safely with `null`

A value that "might not be there" is expressed with `T?` (a nullable type).

```lune
let name: String? = "Ada"
let missing: String? = null
```

Both a non-null value and `null` can go into a `T?`. But you cannot put `null` into a non-null type (like `String`). This is where Lune keeps you safe: if you accidentally mix in a null, the type checker stops you.

To use what is inside a `T?`, you first check whether it is null and unwrap it. There are a few ways.

### Destructure with `match`

`match` handles both `null` and the inner value. If you handle `null` first, the following name is narrowed to the non-null type.

```lune
def orZero(value: Int?): Int =
    match value:
        | null -> 0
        | v -> v
```

In the `v` branch, `value` is known to be non-null, so `v` can be used as an `Int`. If you forget the `null` branch, the match is not exhaustive and is a type error.

### Provide a default with `??`

`a ?? b` returns `b` when `a` is `null` (and does not evaluate `b` when `a` is non-null).

```lune
let shown = missing ?? "anon"
```

### Narrow with `if`

In the then-branch of `if x != null then ...`, `x` is narrowed to non-null.

```lune
def orOne(x: Int?): Int =
    if x != null then x else 1
```

### Navigate safely with `?.`

Record fields can be reached with `?.`. If the receiver is `null`, it short-circuits to `null` instead of navigating.

```lune
record User:
    name: String
    age: Int

def nameOf(user: User?): String? =
    user?.name
```

The type of `user?.name` is `String?`. `nameOf(null)` is `null`; otherwise it returns the name.

### Compare against null

Use `x == null` / `x != null` to check.

The sample `samples/nullable.lune` collects all of these features in one place.

## 12. Small Tools from the Standard Library

Lune v0.1 comes with several useful types and functions out of the box.

```lune
let xs = (1 2 3 4)
let doubled = map(xs, fn x -> x * 2)
let total = fold(doubled, 0, fn acc x -> acc + x)
let answer = total
```

`(1 2 3 4)` is a Lisp-style list literal. `[1, 2, 3, 4]` means the same thing.

Both are short, natural ways to create finite lists instead of writing `Cons(1, Cons(2, Cons(3, Cons(4, Nil))))`.

The empty list is `[]`. Note that `()` means `Unit`, so these are distinct.

`range(1, 5)` also creates the list `1, 2, 3, 4`.

The REPL displays lists in Lisp style:

```text
lune> [1, 2, 3, 4]
(1 2 3 4) : List[Int]
lune> (1 2 3 4)
(1 2 3 4) : List[Int]
lune> "Ada"
"Ada" : String
```

Strings are displayed with double quotes, making them easy to read inside lists and records.

List literal elements are also lazy:

```lune
let items = [1, crash()]
let answer = head(items)
```

`answer` is `Some(1)`. The second element stays asleep until needed.

### Core List Operations

These 7 functions cover a lot of ground for list processing in Lune:

```lune
map(list, fn x -> ...)
filter(list, fn x -> ...)
fold(list, initial, fn acc x -> ...)
take(list, count)
drop(list, count)
head(list)
tail(list)
```

`map` transforms each element:

```lune
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
let doubled = map(numbers, fn x -> x * 2)
```

REPL:

```text
lune> doubled
(2 4 6 8) : List[Int]
```

`filter` keeps only elements that match a condition:

```lune
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
let evens = filter(numbers, fn x -> x % 2 == 0)
```

```text
lune> evens
(2 4 6) : List[Int]
```

`fold` reduces a list to a single value — useful for sums, max values, stringification, etc.:

```lune
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
let total = fold(numbers, 0, fn acc x -> acc + x)
```

`acc` is "the result so far": starts at `0`, then `1`, `3`, `6`, and finally `10`.

`take` and `drop` slice a list from the front:

```lune
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
let firstThree = take(numbers, 3)
let afterThree = drop(numbers, 3)
```

```text
lune> firstThree
(1 2 3) : List[Int]
lune> afterThree
(4 5 6) : List[Int]
```

You can implement paging:

```lune
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
let page1 = take(numbers, 2)
let page2 = take(drop(numbers, 2), 2)
let page3 = take(drop(numbers, 4), 2)
```

`head` and `tail` safely retrieve the first element and the rest. Since an empty list is possible, both return `Option`:

```lune
let numbers = [1, 2, 3]
let first = head(numbers)
let rest = tail(numbers)
let missing = head([])
```

```text
lune> first
Some(1) : Option[Int]
lune> rest
Some((2 3)) : Option[List[Int]]
lune> missing
None : Option[Any]
```

`getOrElse` is handy when you need the actual value:

```lune
let firstNumber = getOrElse(head([10, 20]), 0)
let emptyNumber = getOrElse(head([]), 0)
```

`firstNumber` is `10`, `emptyNumber` is `0`.

### Combining Them

List functions become most satisfying when combined:

```lune
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
let answer =
    fold(
        map(
            filter(numbers, fn x -> x % 2 == 0),
            fn x -> x * 10
        ),
        0,
        fn acc x -> acc + x
    )
```

This pipeline "keeps only evens" → "multiplies by 10" → "sums". `answer` is `120`.

Combining with `record` leads to more practical code:

```lune
record User:
    name: String
    age: Int

let users = [
    User(name = "Ada", age = 36),
    User(name = "Grace", age = 85),
    User(name = "Linus", age = 55),
]

let names = map(users, fn user: User -> user.name)
let elders = filter(users, fn user: User -> user.age >= 60)
let elderNames = map(elders, fn user: User -> user.name)
let totalAge = fold(users, 0, fn acc: Int user: User -> acc + user.age)
```

```text
lune> names
("Ada" "Grace" "Linus") : List[String]
lune> elderNames
("Grace") : List[String]
lune> totalAge
176 : Int
```

### Lazy Evaluation and List Functions

`take` is a tool for retrieving only what you need. `take(list, 0)` does not evaluate the list at all:

```lune
let safe = take(crash(), 0)
```

This is treated as `()` — an empty list.

Furthermore, the tail of the list returned by `take` is also lazy:

```lune
let one = take([1, crash()], 1)
```

```text
lune> one
(1) : List[Int]
```

The second element is not included in the result, so it's never evaluated. Lazy evaluation is very tangible here.

### Sample File

A comprehensive example for this chapter is in `samples/list_tools.lune`:

```sh
./bin/lune --check samples/list_tools.lune
./bin/lune --eval doubled samples/list_tools.lune
./bin/lune --eval adultNames samples/list_tools.lune
```

`Option` is also built in:

```lune
let value = Some(42)
let answer = getOrElse(value, 0)
```

The standard library is still small, but just not having to define `Option` or `List` yourself every time makes experimentation much more pleasant.

## 13. Small Loops with `while`

Lune values functional features, but `while` is available for simple iteration too.

```lune
let answer =
    var i = 0
    var total = 0
    while i < 5:
        total = total + i
        i = i + 1
    total
```

`answer` is `0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10`.

The `while` condition is evaluated each iteration. When the condition becomes `false`, the loop exits and `while` itself returns `Unit`.

```lune
let answer =
    var i = 0
    while i < 3:
        i = i + 1
    i
```

Here `answer` is `3`.

The relationship with lazy evaluation is important: if the condition is `false` from the start, the body is never executed.

```lune
let answer =
    while false:
        crash()
    42
```

`crash()` is never evaluated here.

`while` is convenient, but for Lune-style data transformations, `map`, `filter`, and `fold` are often more readable. A good rule of thumb: `while` for small procedures, functions for data flow.

The same computation can be written recursively:

```lune
def sumUntil(i: Int, end: Int, total: Int): Int =
    if i >= end then total else sumUntil(i + 1, end, total + i)

let answer = sumUntil(0, 5, 0)
```

This `answer` is also `10`.

The `while` version follows steps with mutable variables, which can be easier for new readers. The recursive version passes state as arguments — more functional, easier to test as a small unit.

Lune lets you choose either. A good heuristic: `while` for small procedures, recursion or `fold` for value transformations and reusable computations.

### Compound Assignment, and the Integer-Division Trap

`total = total + i` can be shortened to `total += i`. There are six compound assignments.

```lune
let answer =
    var x = 10
    x += 5      # same as x = x + 5. 15
    x -= 3      # 12
    x *= 2      # 24
    x //= 5     # 4
    x %= 3      # 1
    x
```

`x op= e` means exactly `x = x op e`. Its type and its runtime behaviour both match `x op e`.

Only `/=` needs care. In Lune `/` is **always** true division: `Int / Int` still produces a `Double`. To divide and stay in the integers, use floor division `//`.

```text
lune> 7 / 2
3.5 : Double
lune> 7 // 2
3 : Int
```

So `/=` on an `Int` variable is a type error — the result would be a `Double`.

```text
error[TYP0003]: compound assignment `/=`: expected Int, got Double
  --> half.lune:3:5
  |
3 |     x /= 2
  |     ^
   = help: run `lune explain TYP0003` for a detailed explanation
```

Use `//=` when you want an `Int` to stay an `Int`.

`//` rounds toward negative infinity (floor), not toward zero. `-7 // 2` is `-4`, not `-3`.

```text
lune> -7 // 2
-4 : Int
lune> -7 % 2
1 : Int
```

That may look surprising, but it is what keeps `//` and `%` consistent with each other. For any signs, the quotient and the remainder satisfy:

```text
a == (a // b) * b + (a % b)
```

```text
lune> (-7 // 2) * 2 + (-7 % 2)
-7 : Int
```

`/`, `//` and `%` all raise the runtime error `RUN0006` (division by zero) when the right operand is 0. The type checker does not catch it.

## 14. Walking a List with `for`

`while` repeats as long as a condition holds. When you simply want to process a list in order, `for` is cleaner.

```lune
let answer =
    var total = 0
    for x in [1, 2, 3, 4]:
        total = total + x
    total
```

Since `[1, 2, 3, 4]` is `(1 2 3 4)`, `answer` is `10`.

`for` is a small syntax dedicated to `List[T]`. Writing `for x in items:` binds each element to `x` and executes the body. `for` itself returns `Unit`, so in the example above `total` is placed last to serve as the result.

Patterns work too:

```lune
let pairs = [(1, 10), (2, 20)]

let answer =
    var total = 0
    for (left, right) in pairs:
        total = total + left + right
    total
```

Each tuple's elements are destructured into `left` and `right`. This `answer` is `33`.

The relationship with lazy evaluation: when the list is empty, the body never executes.

```lune
let answer =
    for _ in Nil:
        crash()

`crash()` is never evaluated. `for` advances one step at a time, checking `Cons` vs `Nil`. Element contents are evaluated when needed by the pattern or body.

`for` is well-suited for readable aggregation and side-effectful processing. For building a new list from a list, `map` is great; for filtering, `filter`; for reducing to a value, `fold`.

## 15. Splitting into Modules

When your code grows, you can split it into files.

`math.lune`:

```lune
module math

def add(x: Int, y: Int): Int =
    x + y
```

`main.lune`:

```lune
module main
import math

let answer = add(20, 22)
```

Run:

```sh
./bin/lune --eval answer main.lune
```

In v0.1, top-level names from imported modules are brought into the same environment. So you write `add`, not `math.add`.

## 16. Type Checking and Tooling

Lune has a small type checker.

```lune
let answer: Int = true
```

This is a type error.

```sh
./bin/lune --check bad.lune
```

Errors are displayed with code locations, a diagnostic code (like `TYP0003`), and a fix hint. The type checker is not yet complete, but it catches many basic mistakes.

Beyond *finding* errors, Lune ships small tools to explain, fix, and format your code.

### Learn more about an error: `lune explain`

Read the meaning of a diagnostic code, a minimal example that triggers it, and how to fix it.

```sh
./bin/lune explain TYP0007
```

In the REPL, use `:explain CODE`.

### Fix typos: did you mean, and `lune fix`

When an undefined name is close to a known one, a "did you mean" suggestion appears.

```text
error[TYP0001]: undefined name: totl
   = hint: did you mean `total`?
```

`lune fix` applies that suggestion automatically.

```sh
./bin/lune fix --write myfile.lune   # apply fixes in place
./bin/lune fix --check myfile.lune   # exit 1 if fixes are available (CI)
```

### Format: `lune fmt`

Format to a canonical style. Formatting never changes meaning (it re-parses to check).

```sh
./bin/lune fmt myfile.lune           # print formatted source
./bin/lune fmt --write myfile.lune   # format in place
./bin/lune fmt --check myfile.lune   # exit 1 if not formatted (CI)
```

## 17. Reading Errors, Learning from Errors

In Lune, an error is not a scolding — it is teaching material. In this chapter you will **cause errors on purpose**, read the diagnostic, understand it with `explain`, and repair it with `fix`. Once this loop feels natural, no unfamiliar error will scare you.

### Anatomy of a Diagnostic

First, let's learn to read one diagnostic part by part. Save this as `guide.lune` and run `--check`.

```lune
let count = 10
let total = cont + 5
```

```text
error[TYP0001]: undefined name: cont
  --> guide.lune:2:13
  |
2 | let total = cont + 5
  |             ^^^^ name is not defined
   = hint: did you mean `count`?
   = help: run `lune explain TYP0001` for a detailed explanation
```

Top to bottom:

- `error[TYP0001]` — the severity (error / warning) and the **diagnostic code**. The code is your index into `explain`.
- `--> guide.lune:2:13` — file, line, column.
- The quoted line and `^^^^` — the exact spot. Look here first.
- `= hint:` — a concrete next step. Here it even names the correct candidate.
- `= help:` — the door to a longer explanation.

### Loop One: typo → diagnostic → explain → fix

To learn more than the hint tells you, pass the code to `explain`.

```sh
./bin/lune explain TYP0001
```

You get three things: what it means, a minimal example that triggers it, and how to fix it. Add `--lang ja` to read it **in Japanese** (in the REPL: `:explain TYP0001 ja`). It goes further: `./bin/lune --check --lang ja file.lune` localizes **the diagnostics themselves** — message, caret label, and hint (in the REPL: `:lang ja`). To browse the full catalog of every code, open `documents/ERROR_INDEX.md` (Japanese version: `ERROR_INDEX_JA.md`).

This particular error is mechanically fixable, so let `fix` handle it.

```sh
./bin/lune fix --write guide.lune
./bin/lune --check guide.lune
```

```text
type check OK
```

That is the basic loop: **cause → read → explain → fix → verify**.

### Loop Two: Exhaustiveness — the Compiler Hands You a Counterexample

Next, an error that is about design, not typing.

```lune
type Color =
    | Red
    | Green
    | Blue

def name(c: Color): String =
    match c:
        | Red -> "red"
        | Green -> "green"
```

```text
error[TYP0007]: non-exhaustive match: missing case Blue
  --> guide.lune:7:5
  |
7 |     match c:
  |     ^^^^^ pattern Blue is not covered
   = hint: add a case for Blue, or a wildcard case `| _ -> ...`
   = help: run `lune explain TYP0007` for a detailed explanation
```

Notice it does not just say "non-exhaustive" — it hands you **a witness: the exact value that is not covered (`Blue`)**. Add `| Blue -> "blue"` and it passes.

You could reach for the wildcard `| _ -> ...` instead, but there is a price: when you later add a constructor to `Color`, the compiler can no longer tell you what you forgot. And if you write all the cases *and* a wildcard, you get the mirror-image warning:

```text
warning[TYP0009]: unreachable match case: _
   = hint: remove this case, or move it before the cases that cover it
```

The error (TYP0007) and the warning (TYP0009) are a pair, squeezing your `match` toward "nothing missing, nothing wasted" from both sides.

### Loop Three: Runtime Errors Teach Too

Passing the type check does not rule out failure at run time.

```lune
let x = 1 / 0
```

`--check` passes, but `--eval x` reports:

```text
error[RUN0006]: division by zero
   = hint: the right operand of `/` evaluated to 0
   = help: run `lune explain RUN0006` for a detailed explanation
```

Runtime errors speak the same language — code, hint, explain. In the REPL, `:thunks x` even shows you that the failure was memoized (chapter 6).

### Exercises: Produce the Error

Normal exercises ask you to write something that works. These are inverted: **you win by producing the requested diagnostic**. Check your answers with `lune explain CODE` and `documents/ERROR_INDEX.md`.

1. Produce `TYP0003` (type mismatch).
2. Produce `REC0002` (unknown record field) in a way that gets a "did you mean" hint.
3. Produce `LAY0002` (unmatched closing delimiter).
4. Produce `TYP0008` (refutable pattern in let). Hint: `let Some(x) = ...`
5. `RUN0005` (recursive thunk evaluation) can only be produced in the REPL. Why? Hint: what does `--check` catch first?

Once you can produce errors at will, you can fix them at will.

## 18. Writing a Small Program

Here is an example that brings several features together:

```lune
module tutorial

record User:
    name: String
    age: Int

type Greeting =
    | Greeting(text: String)

def adultLabel(user: User): String =
    if user.age >= 20 then "adult" else "young"

def greet(user: User): Greeting =
    Greeting("Hello, " + user.name + " (" + adultLabel(user) + ")")

def render(greeting: Greeting): String =
    match greeting:
        | Greeting(text) -> text

def birthdayMessage(user: User): String =
    var years = 0
    while years < 1:
        years = years + 1
    "next year: " + user.name

let ada = User(name = "Ada", age = 36)
let answer = render(greet(ada))
```

Evaluate:

```sh
./bin/lune --eval answer tutorial.lune
```

Result:

```text
'Hello, Ada (adult)'
```

It's starting to take shape. Lune is a language where you "model data shapes with types, evaluate only what you need, and decompose readably with `match`."

`birthdayMessage` is a slightly contrived example, but it shows that `while` works naturally inside a block. Likewise, `for` can be used inside a block wherever list traversal is needed.

## 19. Exercises

1. Create a `record Book` with fields `title: String` and `pages: Int`.
2. Write `isLong(book: Book): Bool` that returns `true` for books with 300 or more pages.
3. Create `type MaybeLong = LongBook(title: String) | ShortBook(title: String)`.
4. Write `classify(book: Book): MaybeLong` and convert it to a display string with `match`.
5. Try reading only `pages` from `Book(title = crash(), pages = 100)` and see what happens.
6. Use `while` to compute the sum of `1` through `10`.
7. Use `for` and `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` to compute the sum.
8. In the REPL, use the up arrow to recall a previous expression, edit it slightly, and re-run it.

The last exercise captures something essential about this language: what you don't use is still sleeping.

## 20. Current Limitations

Lune v0.1 is still an early version.

Notable missing features:

- class / interface.
- Native Java interop.
- Record update syntax.
- Record patterns.
- Mutable record fields.
- `try` / `catch`.
- `break` / `continue`.
- LSP / package manager (formatting is available as `lune fmt`).

Meanwhile, several things that used to be "not yet" now work: `for`, `T?` (null safety), `|>`, and `lune explain` / `lune fmt` / `lune fix`.

But the core feeling is already there:

```lune
let add = fn x y -> x + y
let inc = add(1)
let answer = inc(41)
```

This small expression captures the direction of Lune.

Lazy evaluation, evaluate only when needed, pass functions as values, model data shapes with types.  
From here, the language grows, one small step at a time.
